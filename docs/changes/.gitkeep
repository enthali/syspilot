# Change Documents Directory

This folder contains active Change Documents (CHG-NNN.md).

After a change is merged to main, the Change Document should be deleted.
The Git history preserves the full document.

To find old change documents:
  git log --all --full-history -- "docs/changes/CHG-*.md"
  git show <commit>:docs/changes/CHG-001.md

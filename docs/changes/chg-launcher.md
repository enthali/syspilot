# Change Document: chg-launcher

**Status**: in-progress
**Branch**: feature/chg-launcher
**Created**: 2026-07-28
**Author**: PM
**Operation Mode**: autonomous

## Summary

Introduce a `syspilot.change-launcher` skill that automates the four mechanical steps at the start of every change initiative: create the feature branch from `development`, copy the change-document template, and pre-fill the five header fields (Status, Branch, Created, Author, Operation Mode) before making the initial commit. These steps are deterministic and require no judgment, but they are a recurring source of errors (wrong fields touched, Operation Mode forgotten, CM territory inadvertently modified). Offloading them to a script lets the PM focus immediately on the Summary — the one part that genuinely requires human intent. The skill is delivered as a Python script under `syspilot/skills/syspilot.change-launcher/`, installed by the Setup Agent, and backed by new spec elements `SYSP_US_CHG_LAUNCHER` / `SYSP_REQ_CHG_LAUNCHER` / `SYSP_SPEC_CHG_LAUNCHER`.

### Artefakt-Removal-Check

*Fill in only when this CR removes an artefact (file, field, configuration key, REQ-ID).*

For each removed artefact, run a project-wide grep on all plausible name variants and classify results:

| Removed Artefact | Class (a): Code/Workflow refs | Class (b): Doc refs | Class (c): Historic Change Docs |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `{artefact name}` | {files + lines fixed / none} | {files + lines fixed / none} | {count — acceptable historic stranding} |

- [ ] All class (a) active code/workflow references fixed in this CR
- [ ] All class (b) active documentation references fixed in this CR
- [ ] Class (c) historical Change Documents accepted as "acceptable historic stranding" and disclosed above

### Issues Found

- [ ] Issue 2: ...

### Sign-off

- [ ] All levels completed (no ⚠️ DEPRECATED markers remaining)
- [ ] All conflicts resolved
- [ ] Traceability verified
- [ ] Ready for implementation

## QM Findings

*QM writes findings directly into this section after each review round. PM records
decisions (fix-now / defer / accept-as-is) with rationale in the same section.
Multiple review rounds are appended as sub-sections. Existing CDs without this
section are unaffected — the section is additive, never required retroactively.*

### Round 1

**Reviewed by:** QM
**Review date:** {DATE}

#### Findings

| # | Level | Element ID | Finding | Severity |
|---|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | L? | {ID} | {description} | high / medium / low |

#### PM Decisions

| # | Finding # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | fix-now / defer / accept-as-is | {rationale} |
